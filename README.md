# Spectro - Low-Cost Hydrogen Production using Green Algae for Sustainable Energy Generation

**Description:**
This GitHub repository contains the project "Spectro," which aims to address Sri Lanka's energy crisis by offering an innovative solution for electricity generation and energy storage. The project utilizes green algae's biochemical processes to produce hydrogen gas, a sustainable and low-cost energy source.

**Objective:**
The primary objective of Spectro is to develop a feasible method for hydrogen generation using green algae through the indirect photolysis (two-stage) process. This involves a combination of photosynthesis and fermentation to produce hydrogen gas, reducing the country's dependency on expensive and environmentally harmful energy sources.

**Key Features:**
1. Two-Stage Hydrogen Generation: Spectro employs a two-stage process, utilizing photosynthesis and fermentation, to efficiently produce hydrogen gas from green algae.
2. Tidal Energy-Powered Pipeline: The generated hydrogen gas is efficiently transferred to the mainland using a pipeline powered by natural tidal energy, eliminating the need for external motors.
3. Sustainable Wastage Utilization: The project incorporates a special compression method to collect and utilize algae wastage, generating biodiesel and further promoting environmental sustainability.
4. GitHub Repository: This repository houses all project-related codes, documentation, and research findings, providing an open-source platform for collaboration and development.

**Energy Comparison:**
Spectro's annual hydrogen gas production is compared with various existing energy sources, including gasoline, coal, and natural gas, demonstrating its potential as a viable and environmentally friendly alternative.

**Cost Analysis:**
The repository includes cost calculations for barium chloride usage during the hydrogen production process, providing insights into the economical aspects of the project.

**Hydrogen Generation Efficiency:**
Based on research findings and experimental data, the repository contains information on Chlorella vulgaris' efficiency in hydrogen production under diverse photoperiods.

**Team Spectro:**
The project is carried out by Team Spectro, a group of passionate individuals committed to sustainable energy solutions for Sri Lanka's energy crisis.

**Contributions and Collaboration:**
We welcome contributions and collaborations from the community to further enhance and develop Spectro as an effective and accessible solution for sustainable energy generation.

Join us in our endeavor to revolutionize Sri Lanka's energy landscape with Spectro's innovative hydrogen production method!
