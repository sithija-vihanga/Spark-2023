# Algagen - Low-Cost Hydrogen Production using Green Algae for Sustainable Energy Generation by Team Spectro

## Project Description
Welcome to the Algagen project repository, brought to you by Team Spectro! Algagen is a pioneering solution designed to address the energy crisis in Sri Lanka. By harnessing the power of green algae's biochemical processes, we aim to revolutionize electricity generation and energy storage in an eco-friendly and cost-effective manner.

## Objective
Algagen's primary objective is to develop a cutting-edge method for hydrogen generation using green algae through an indirect photolysis (two-stage) process. By combining photosynthesis and fermentation, we can produce hydrogen gas efficiently, reducing reliance on expensive imported fuels and mitigating environmental pollution.

## Key Features
1. **Two-Stage Hydrogen Generation:** Algagen leverages a two-stage process, integrating photosynthesis and fermentation, to maximize hydrogen gas production from green algae. This process ensures optimal energy efficiency and sustainability.

2. **Tidal Energy-Powered Pipeline:** Our ingenious design facilitates the seamless transfer of generated hydrogen gas to the mainland using a pipeline powered by natural tidal energy. This eco-conscious approach eliminates the need for external motors and reduces environmental impact.

3. **Sustainable Wastage Utilization:** Algagen incorporates an innovative compression method that collects and utilizes algae wastage, producing biodiesel as a valuable by-product. This waste-to-energy process enhances environmental sustainability while maximizing resource utilization.

4. **GitHub Repository:** This repository serves as the central hub for all Algagen-related content, including source codes, documentation, research findings, and collaboration resources. Embracing open-source principles, we encourage contributions from the community to further refine and enhance the project.

## Energy Comparison
Algagen's annual hydrogen gas production surpasses conventional energy sources, including gasoline, coal, and natural gas. By providing detailed energy comparison metrics, we demonstrate the substantial potential of hydrogen as a clean and abundant alternative.

## Cost Analysis
Within the repository, we present meticulous cost calculations pertaining to barium chloride usage during the hydrogen production process. This comprehensive analysis sheds light on Algagen's cost-effectiveness and economic viability.

## Hydrogen Generation Efficiency
Drawing from extensive research and empirical data, we delve into Chlorella vulgaris' hydrogen generation efficiency under diverse photoperiods. Our findings reinforce the efficiency and reliability of Algagen's chosen algae strain.

## Contributions and Collaboration
Team Spectro invites collaborators, researchers, and enthusiasts to actively participate in the Algagen project. We foster a collaborative environment where ideas converge, expertise amalgamates, and innovation thrives. Join us in our mission to drive positive change and usher Sri Lanka towards a sustainable energy future.

## Project Status
At its current stage, Algagen is undergoing rapid development and iterative refinement. We welcome feedback, insights, and suggestions from the community to bolster the project's success and impact.

Let's unite our efforts and pave the way for a greener and more prosperous Sri Lanka with Algagen's revolutionary hydrogen production method!
